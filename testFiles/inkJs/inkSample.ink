//  Intro
    - 	They are keeping me waiting.
        *	Hut 14[]. The door was locked after I sat down.
        I don't even have a pen to do any work. There's a copy of the morning's intercept in my pocket, but staring at the jumbled letters will only drive me mad.
        I am not a machine, whatever they say about me.

    - (opts)
        {|I rattle my fingers on the field table.|}
            * 	(think) [Think]
                They suspect me to be a traitor. They think I stole the component from the calculating machine. They will be searching my bunk and cases.
            When they don't find it, {plan:then} they'll come back and demand I talk.
            -> opts
            *	(plan) [Plan]
                {not think:What I am is|I am} a problem—solver. Good with figures, quick with crosswords, excellent at chess.
                But in this scenario — in this trap — what is the winning play?
                * * 	(cooperate) [Co—operate]
                        I must co—operate. My credibility is my main asset. To contradict myself, or another source, would be fatal.
                        I must simply hope they do not ask the questions I do not want to answer.
                        ~ lower(forceful)
                * * 	[Dissemble]
                        Misinformation, then. Just as the war in Europe is one of plans and interceptions, not planes and bombs.
                        My best hope is a story they prefer to the truth.
                        ~ raise(forceful)
                * * 	(delay) [Divert]
                        Avoidance and delay. The military machine never fights on a single front. If I move slowly enough, things will resolve themselves some other way, my reputation intact.

        -
            *	[Watch him]
            His face is telling me nothing. I've seen Harris broad and full of laughter. Today he is tight, as much part of the military machine as the device in Hut 5.

            *	[Wait]
                I wait to see how he'll respond.

    // Past Hooper
    Harris gets to his feet. "All right," he says. "I should no better than to trust a clever man, but we'll give it a go."
    Then, he smiles, with all his teeth, like a wolf.
        { claim_hooper_took_component.hoopers_hut_3:
        "Especially since this is a plan that involves keeping you in handcuffs. I don't see what I have to lose."

    }
    // Leading you past Hooper
    He raps on the door for the guard and gives the man a quick instruction. He returns a moment later with a cool pair of iron cuffs.
    "Put 'em up," Harris instructs, and I do so. The metal closes around my wrists like a trap. I stand and follow Harris willingly out through the door.
    But whatever I'm doing with my body, my mind is scheming. <i>Somehow,</i> I'm thinking, <i>I have to get away from these men long enough to get that component behind Hut 2 and put it somewhere Hooper will go. Or, otherwise, somehow get Hooper to go there himself...</i>
    Harris marches me over to Hut 3, and gestures for the guard to stand aside. Pushing me forward, he opens the door nice and wide.
    // Hut 3
    "Captain. Manning talked. If you'd step out for a moment?"
        * 	[Play the part, head down]
            From where he's sitting, I know Hooper can see me, so I keep my head down and look guilty as sin. The bastard is probably smiling.


        * 	[Look inside the hut]
        I look in through the door and catch Hooper's expression. I had half expected him to be smiling be he isn't. He looks shocked, almost hurt. "Iain," he murmurs. "You couldn't..."

        * 	(shouted) [Call to Hooper]
            I have a single moment to shout something to Hooper before the door closes.
        "I'll get you Hooper, you'll see!" I cry. Then:

                * * "Queen to rook two, checkmate!"[] I call, then laugh viciously, as if I am damning him straight to hell.

            - - (only_catch) I only catch Hooper's reaction for a moment — his eyebrow lifts in surprise and alarm. Good. If he thinks it is a threat then he just might be careless enough to go looking for what it might mean.

                * * "Ask not for whom the bell tolls!"
            He stares back at me, as if were a madman and perhaps for a split second I see him shudder.


                * * "Two words: messy, without one missing!"[] I cry, laughing. It isn't the best clue, hardly worthy of The Times, but it will have to do.

    "No," the Commander admits, in a low voice. "I'm afraid not. Rather more a scheme. The idea is to let Hooper go and see what he does. If he believes we have Manning here in irons, he'll try to shift the component."
    "If he has it."
    "Indeed."
    The Captain peers at me for a moment, like I was some kind of curious insect.
    "Sometimes, I think you people are magicians," he remarks. "Other times you seem more like witches. Very well."
    With that he opens the door to the Hut and goes back inside. The Commander uses the moment to hustle me roughly forward.

        The Captain, looking puzzled, steps out. The door is closed. Hooper stares at me, open—mouthed, about to say something. I probably have less than a minute before the Captain storms back in and declares this plan to be bunkum.

                "Listen to me, Hooper. We were the only men in that hut today, so we know what happened. But I want you to know this.

    Enough of this. There isn't any time to lose. Right now they'll be following Hooper as he goes to bed, and goes to sleep; and then that's it. The minute he closes his eyelids and drifts off that's the moment that this trap swings shut on me.

=== go_to_hoopers_dorm
    // Hooper's Dorm
    I creep around the outside of the huts towards Hooper's dorm. Time to wrap up this little game once and for all. A few guards patrol the area at night but not many — after all, very few know this place even exists.
    Our quarters are arranged away from the main house; where we sleep is of less importance than where we work. We each have our own hut, through some are less permanent than others. Hooper's is a military issue tent: quite a large canopy, with two rooms inside and a short porch area where he insists people leave their shoes. It's all zipped up for the night and no light shines from inside.
    I hang back for a moment. If Harris is keeping to the terms of our deal then someone will be watching this place. But I can see no—one.
        * (outer_zip) [Open the outer zip]
                I creep forward to the tent, intent on lifting the zip to the front porch area just a little — enough to slip the component inside, and without the risk of the noise waking Hooper from his snoring.
            The work is careful, and more than little fiddly — Hooper has tied the zips down on the inside, the fastidious little bastard! — but after a little work I manage to make a hole large enough for my hand.
            * * [Slip in the component]
                    I slide the component into the tent, work the zip closed, and move quickly away into the shadows. It takes a few minutes for my breath to slow, and my heart to stop hammering, but I see no other movement. If anyone is watching Hooper's tent, they are asleep at their posts.
                        ~ putcomponentintent  = true

            * * [No, some other way]
                    Then pause. This is too transparent. Too blatant. If I leave it here, like this, Hooper will never be seen to go looking for it: he will stumble over it in plain sight, and the men watching will wonder why it was not there when he went to bed.
                    No, I must try something else — or nothing at all.
                    * * * 	[On top of the tent] -> put_component_on_tent

                    * * * 	[Give up]
                            There is nothing to be gained here. I have the component now; maybe it will be of some value tomorrow.

        * (wide_circuit) [Look for another opening]
                Making a wide circuit I creep around the tent. It has plenty of other flaps and openings, tied down with Gordian complexity. But nothing afford itself to slipping the component inside.

            * * [Try on top of the tent] 		-> put_component_on_tent
            * * [Give up]
                It's no good. Nothing I can do will be any less than obvious — something appearing where something was not there before. The men watching Hooper will know it is a deception and Hooper's protestations will be taken at face value.
                If I can't find a way for Hooper to pick the component up, as if from a hiding place of his own devising, and be caught doing it, then I have no plan at all.

= put_component_on_tent
    A neat idea strikes me. If I could place it on top of the canvas, somewhere in the middle where it would bow the cloth inwards, then it would be invisible to anyone passing by. But to Hooper, it would be above him: a shadow staring him in the face as he awoke. What could be more natural than getting up, coming out, and looking to see what had fallen on him during the night?

    It's the work of a moment. I was once an excellent bowler for the second XI back at school. This time I throw underarm, of course, but I still land the vital missing component exactly where I want it to go.

        - - 	"The Captain went back into that hut and he confessed immediately. We were so surprised we didn't let you go." He wrinkles his nose. "I'm rather sorry about that now. I suggest you have a wash."

                * * 	[Wait]
                    I hang back a moment. Something does not seem quite right. After all, Hooper did not steal the component. He has no reason to confess to anything. Perhaps this is another trap?
                "Well?" Harris asks. "What are you waiting for? Please don't tell me <i>you</i> want to confess now as well, I don't think my head could stand it."

                                        I see. Perhaps you think I bullied the man into giving himself up. Perhaps he understood my little clue far enough to know it was a threat against him, but not well enough to understand where he should look to find it. So he took the easy route out and folded. Gave me the hand.

    And then everything will proceed as before. The component will mean nothing to the Germans — this is the one fact I could never have explained to a man like Harris, even though the principle behind the Bombe is the same as the principle behind the army.

- I wave to him and move away, my thoughts turning to the young man in the village. My lover. My contact. My blackmailer. Hooper may have taken the fall for the missing component, but { not framedhooper :if he did recover it from Hut 2 then | its recovery does mean }I have nothing to sell to save my reputation{ i_met_a_young_man :, if I have any left}.

=== go_to_where_component_is_hidden
    It won't take a moment to settle the matter. I can justify a walk past Hut 2 as part of my morning stroll. It will be obvious in a moment if the component is still there.
    On my way across the paddocks, between the huts and the House, I catch sight of young Miss Lyon, arriving for work on her bicycle. She giggles as she sees me and waves.
        * 	[Wave back]
                I wave cheerily back and she giggles, almost drops her bicycle, then dashes away inside the House. Judging by the clock on the front gable, she's running a little late this morning.
        * 	[Ignore her]
                I give no reaction. She sighs to herself, as if this kind of behaviour is normal, and trots away inside the House to begin her duties.
    - 	I turn the corner of Hut 3 and walk down the short gravel path to Hut 2. It was a good spot to choose — Hut 2 is where the electricians work, and they're generally focussed on what they're doing. They don't often come outside to smoke a cigarette so it's easy to slip past the doorway unnoticed.
        * 	[Check inside]
                I hop up the steps and put my head inside all the same. Nobody about. Still too early in the AM for sparks, I suppose. <>
        * 	[Go around the back]

    - 	I head on around the back of the hut. The breeze—block with the cavity is on the left side.
        * 	(check) [Check]
                No time to waste. I drop to my knees and check the breeze—block. Sure enough, there's nothing there. <i>Hooper took the bait.</i>
            Suddenly, there's a movement behind me. I look up to see, first a snub pistol, and then, Harris.

        * 	[Look around]
                I pause to glance around, and catch a glimpse of movement. Someone ducking around the corner of the hut. Or a canvas sheet flapping in the light breeze. Impossible to be sure.
                * * 	[Check the breeze—block] -> check
                * * 	[Check around the side of the hut]

                        Harris is there, leaning in against the wall. He holds a stub pistol in his hand.

                "I have, rather." I put my hands into my pockets. "I seem to have done exactly that."
            "I'm afraid my little story about Hooper confessing wasn't true. I wanted to see if you'd go to retrieve the part." Harris gestures me to start walking. "You were close, Manning, I'll give you that. I wanted to believe you. But I'm glad I didn't."

            Harris stares at me for a moment, then laughs. "Oh, goodness. That's rich."
            I almost wish I had a way to make the hut explode, but of course I don't.

    - 	"Enough." Harris gestures for me to start walking. "This story couldn't be simpler. You took it to cover your back. You hid it. You lied to get Hooper into trouble, and when you thought you'd won, you came to scoop your prize. A good hand but ultimately, { hooperClueType <= STRAIGHT  :if it hadn't have been you who hid the component, then you wouldn't be here now|you told Hooper where to look with your little riddle}."

                    No. What would be the use? He will be long gone, and the name he told me is no doubt hokum. No: I was alone before in guilt, and I am thus alone again.
            * 	[Lie]
                    No. Why would I? He is no doubt an innocent himself, trapped by some dire circumstance. Forced to act the way he did. I have every sympathy for him.
                Of course I do.
            * 	[Evade]
                    It depends, perhaps, on what his name his worth. If it were to prove valuable, well; perhaps I can concoct a few more such lovers with which to ease my later days.

        He drags me up to my feet.
        "You think you have to re—invent everything."
        With that, he hustles me out of the door and I can't help thinking that, with a little more strategy, I could still have won the day. But too late now, of course.
