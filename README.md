# Yarn

Dialogue editor created for "Night in the Woods" (and other projects) by @NoelFB and @infinite_ammo with contributions from @seiyria and @beeglebug. It is heavily inspired by and based on the amazing Twine software: http://twinery.org/

This is a port to electron, made possible by Todor Imreorov. It adds a number of new features, such as:
- Helper menu to create node links - with a search filter
- Support for multiple app instances and file drag and drop
- Automatic creation of nodes with correct name and path when writing any new story threads that have no node created yet
- Ability to copy/paste nodes
-  Ability to run as a web app with propper file open and save functionality

# BBcode styling in editor, Spellchecking, Autocompletion, and more!
- Optional syntax autocompletion (autoclose tags)
- preview of bbcode tag effects and goto in trimmed nodes
- optional spell checking
- optional word guessing and autocompletion
- optional preview bbcode in editor mode
- a color picker (using spectrum.js) to set font color in bbcode
- emoji picker to insert emojis
- new context menu
- misspelled word suggestions in the new context menu - if you have selected a misspelled word
- similar word suggestions in the new context menu (thesaurus)
- nodelink suggestions as you type in the right places
- Night mode - Toggling it will invert all the light colors which the editor currently uses
- A context menu command to visit other nodes via their links in the editor and even create new ones
- Button to go back to the previous edited node. If there is no previous - save and close the current one

# How to Connect Nodes

Node connections work similar to Twine.

# Shortcut Options

Shortcut options are a new method of creating dialogue branches that does not require creating new nodes.

# How to Import Twine Files

One way to import Twine files into Yarn is to export a "Twee" file from Twine. (txt format) Open this txt file in Yarn as you would any other file.

Note: This method of importing will not preserve node locations, just each node's title, body and tags.
