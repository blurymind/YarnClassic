# üéÆ Game engines that bundle Yarn editor
There are a few game engines that have YarnEditor bundled with their IDE. That means that you can use it straight in those engines, without need to save files and open files and so on. It's directly integratedin their workflow!

- Gdevelop : A full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create HTML5 and native games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.
https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop

- Ct.js : A desktop game editor that makes learning programming fun and game development easy by its visual editors and well-documented code library.
https://github.com/ct-js/ct-js

# üß† Yarn runtimes
The runtime is a library that allows your game engine to parse the files that yarn creates. There are a couple of popular ones that you can use. If you have created a runtime, you are working on one or want to get one included with your game engine, these can be of some use to you

- YarnSpinner : A C# library for interactive dialogue in games! Ideal  if you are using Unity3d or another C# game engine!
https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner

- Bondagejs : A Javascript-based parser for the Yarn dialogue tree markup language. Ideal if your game engine uses html5 technologies to run (Gdevelop and ctjs use it).

# How to Connect Nodes

Node connections work similar to Twine.

# Shortcut Options

Shortcut options are a new method of creating dialogue branches that does not require creating new nodes.

# How to Import Twine Files

One way to import Twine files into Yarn is to export a "Twee" file from Twine. (txt format) Open this txt file in Yarn as you would any other file.

Note: This method of importing will not preserve node locations, just each node's title, body and tags.

# How to Run Your Dialogue in Unity
